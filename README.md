# polar-pi
 Visualizing the digits of pi on the polar coordinate plane

 ## Methods

 Using the Nilakantha Series, the first 1000 digits of pi are calculated and loaded into an array. Each digit ~n~ is used to calculate a polar coordinate where ~r = n~ and ~theta = n * 36~ converted into radians. The polar coordinates are converted into Cartesian coordinates and plotted on a (ridiculously large) html canvas.
